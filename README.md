# Tensorflow-example-for-beginners
This is a step by step guide on implementing a Tensorflow-keras model. This is made for those with minimal experience in Python, some understanding of machine learning theory, and minimal experience in writing machine learning algorithems in Python.



# Downloading the files
Go to http://lesun.weebly.com/hyperspectral-data-set.html, scroll to Indian Pines, and download the following files: "corrected Indian Pines (5.7 MB)" and "Indian Pines groundtruth (1.1 KB)".



# Brief understanding of the data
Whenever we are working with an unfamiliar dataset, it is best to examine it before writing down any code. From the website we have we can see that we are working with <b>hyperspectral data</b> collected from an [AVRIS sensor](https://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/), which is basically a drone that uses [spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy) over a large area of land.

The first file "Indian_pines_corrected.mat" will contain a 3D array of 145 by 145 pixels, each with 224 spectral points, meaning we have a 3D matrix or array that is 145x145x224. Note that the 145x145 pixels contain information from a standard camera and are not spectral points.

The second file "Indian_pines_gt.mat" will contain a 2D array of 145 by 145 pixels, with each pixel containing a value from the groundtruth table from the [website](http://lesun.weebly.com/hyperspectral-data-set.html). So for example an array containing five 4's in a row [4,4,4,4,4], will have 5 corn pixels in a row.

So just from looking at the website we can tell that the first file are our features, and the second file are the labels. This means we are able to use machine learning/deep learning/Tensorflow/Keras to classify the AVRIS sensor spectral data to crop type.
